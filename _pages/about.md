I am a Assistant Research Scientist at Johns Hopkins University, currently working under the guidance of [Prof. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/rama-chellappa/). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Video Analytics Lab at the [Computational and Data Sciences](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/) department of the Indian Institute of Science, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. R. Venkatesh babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/). Prior to joining JHU, I served as a Research Scientist at TCS Research in Bangalore, where I contributed to the computer vision research team led by [Dr. Jayavardhana Gubbi](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=Ec2g4ewAAAAJ&hl=en). My research primarily focuses on computational photography, with a particular interest in High Dynamic Range Imaging, Image Processing, and Computer Vision. For a comprehensive overview of my work, please visit the [Research](portfolio/) and [Publications](publications/) page.
