Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Prof. Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/faculty/rama-chellappa/). Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in the Video Analytics Lab ([Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/)) under the guidance of [Prof. R. Venkatesh babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/). My research involves computational photography - especially High Dynamic Range Imaging, Image Processing, and Computer Vision.
